# MetaModule Patch Serialization

This library provides the serialization and deserialization (parsing) of the patch format for the MetaModule.

Patches are saved as yaml files.

### Dependencies

This library depends rapidyaml, which is a submodule in ryml/.

It also depends on the 4ms [cpputil](https://github.com/4ms/cpputil) library, which is not 
included as a submodule for simplicity.
